# Purpose and Objective    
Four Power BI dashboards have been developed to monitor and analyze user behavior during mental health sessions across four key areas: Question Response Performance, Mood Fluctuation Tracking, Engagement Levels, and Chat Text Interactions. 
      
These dashboards provide real-time, dynamic insights into participant performance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Visualizations include statistical data such as box plots, histograms, bar charts, word clouds, chord graph, line graphs, key performance indicators (KPIs), and text engineering, offering a comprehensive view of participants' behavioral performance trends, sentiment analysis and interactions.
