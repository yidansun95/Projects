# Projects Description
### Behavioral Analysis 
- Tool/Format: Power BI
- Purpose: Four Power BI dashboards have been developed to monitor and analyze user behavior during mental health sessions across four key areas: Question Response Performance, Mood Fluctuation Tracking, Engagement Levels, and Chat Text Interactions. 
- Process: These dashboards provide real-time, dynamic insights into participant performance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Visualizations include statistical data such as box plots, histograms, bar charts, word clouds, chord graph, line graphs, key performance indicators (KPIs), and text engineering, offering a comprehensive view of participants' behavioral performance trends, sentiment analysis and interactions.


### Text Engineering
- Tool/Format: Python,SQL,Azure Data Studio, NoSQL(Cosmos),Power BI
- Purpose: clean text data and get more insights in participants' behaviors from word cloud, words frequency, words spam list
- Process:Preprocessed millions of mental health session participants' chat data from Azure Data Studio into Python for natural language processing. Implemented tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming using NLP packages. Developed a text spam detector and integrated the processed data into Power BI to visualize insights through word clouds, word frequency analysis, and real-time chat spam alerts, with breakdowns ranging from monthly to daily trends.


### Data Warehousing for California Cosmetic Chemicals System 
- Tool/Format: SQL(Snowflake),Tableau
- Purpose: Data warehousing and 
- Process:Transformed flat excel sheet of data from year 2009 to 2020 into structured data warehouse. Designed ERD, built data warehouse and star schema, implemented ETL process of data cleaning for 116,000 data in Snowflake. Generated chemicals usage ranks for company, brand, subcategory. Visualized data insights in Tableau and elaborated final report to extract insights.


### Game Match Prediction
- Format: Python
- Purpose: Trained test data, implemented different machine learning models and adjusted own strategy to get the best accuracy for predicting game final result from first 15 mins Diamond Rank data (Data Source: Kaggle)
- Process: Approached statistical data exploration, Correlation Matrix over features, 7 Machine Learning Models( KNN, Logistics Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and adjusted different combination of models and own strategy to get the best accuracy for prediction around 78%
