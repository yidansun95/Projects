# Description

### Game Match Prediction
- File Format: Python Script
- Purpose: Trained test data and implemented different machine learning models and adjusted own strategy to get the best accuracy for predicting game final result from first 15 mins Diamond Rank data (Data Source: Kaggle)

- Process: Approached statistical data exploration, Correlation Matrix over features, 7 Machine Learning Models( KNN, Logistics Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and adjusted different combination of models and own strategy to get the best accuracy for prediction around 78%


### Behavorial Analysis 
- File Format: Power BI
- Purpose: Four Power BI dashboards have been developed to monitor and analyze user behavior during mental health sessions across four key areas: Question Response Performance, Mood Fluctuation Tracking, Engagement Levels, and Chat Text Interactions. 
      
- Process: These dashboards provide real-time, dynamic insights into participant performance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Visualizations include statistical data such as box plots, histograms, bar charts, word clouds, chord graph, line graphs, key performance indicators (KPIs), and text engineering, offering a comprehensive view of participants' behavioral performance trends, sentiment analysis and interactions.
